# Roxas Mod G Rando Compet Companion
Welcome to the Roxas Mod G! A modpack of companion mods for the newly released "Roxas Mod 3.0" for Epic PC Kingdom Hearts 2! These mods aren't a part of the official release, but seek to give players even greater control over their Roxas Mod experience!

Designed for use with the OpenKH Mod Loader.

---

A patch built specially for those who play KH2 Rando competitively! This reverses certain changes in the base Roxas Mod/Roxas Randomizer Fix, such as the symbols for Hollow Bastion and Simulated Twilight Town, as well as certain script changes (reverting "Promise Form" back to "Limit Form"). Comes pre-packaged with the Roxas Mod G: Medium Animations mod, for maximum Roxas flavor with none of the gameplay impact! Built to be tournament legal and streamlined as possible!
