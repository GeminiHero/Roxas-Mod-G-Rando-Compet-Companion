# Roxas Mod G Rando Compet Companion
Welcome to the Roxas Mod G! A modpack of companion mods for the newly released "Roxas Mod 3.0" for Epic PC Kingdom Hearts 2! These mods aren't a part of the official release, but seek to give players even greater control over their Roxas Mod experience!

Designed for use with the OpenKH Mod Loader.

---

A patch built specially for those who play KH2 Rando competitively! This reverses certain changes in the base Roxas Mod/Roxas Randomizer Fix, such as the symbols for Hollow Bastion and Simulated Twilight Town, as well as certain script changes (reverting "Promise Form" back to "Limit Form"). Built to be tournament legal and streamlined as possible!

**IMPORTANT!**

Make sure to use this mod with either "Roxas Mod: Sora Moveset" from the official pack, or either the "Roxas Mod G Lite Animations" or "Roxas Mod G Medium Animations" from this modpack if you want to be legal for most tournaments! The base mod has some modified moves otherwise, and for logistical reasons this mod cannot overwrite those on its own!

Make sure to place this mod above "Roxas Mod 3.0" AND any randomizer seeds or mods.
