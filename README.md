# Roxas Mod G Rando Compet Companion
Welcome to the Roxas Mod G! A modpack of companion mods for the newly released "Roxas Mod 3.0" for Epic PC Kingdom Hearts 2! These mods aren't a part of the official release, but seek to give players even greater control over their Roxas Mod experience!

Designed for use with the OpenKH Mod Loader.

---

A patch built specially for those who play KH2 Rando competitively! This reverses certain changes in the base Roxas Mod/Roxas Randomizer Fix, such as the symbols for Hollow Bastion and Simulated Twilight Town, as well as certain script changes (reverting "Promise Form" back to "Limit Form"). Built to be tournament legal and streamlined as possible!

## **IMPORTANT!**

Comes pre-packaged with the "Roxas Mod G Medium Animations" mod, so you'll be tournament legal right from the start! Place ABOVE all roxas mods and randomizer mods! 

If you want to use even less of Roxas' animations to cut down on snapping, please consider stacking the "Roxas Mod G: Lite Animations" ontop, found here: 

GeminiHero/Roxas-Mod-G-Lite-Animations

or "Roxas Mod Sora Animations" found here:

Napstio/Roxas-Mod-Sora-Animation-For-Speed-Run

If you wish to use Roxas' full animation set from the base mod, but still want things like the new Kingdom Key to be seen over the randomizer mods, please use the "Roxas Mod Randomizer Fix" from Napstio, found here instead. PLEASE BE AWARE that this full moveset will not be legal in most tournaments right now, so make sure to ask your TO if you want to use this instead of the Compet Companion!

### IF YOU ARE USING A TRACKER

Please feel free to download these custom images, which replace Sora with Roxas on the tracker and vice versa! NOTE: If you are instead using the "Roxas Mod Randomizer Fix" ( Napstio/Roxas-Mod-Randomiser-Fix ), make SURE you use the "New World Icons" version from this link, as that mod changes the world icons in the Garden of Assemblage!

Make sure to place "Roxas Mod G Rando Compet Companion" ABOVE "Roxas Mod 3.0" AND any randomizer seeds or mods.
